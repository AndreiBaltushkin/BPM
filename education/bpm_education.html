        <header><h2>10/30/2022 learn AJAX</h2></header>
        <p>
            <abbr title="Asynchronous Javascript And XML">AJAX</abbr> helps accomplish making requests to load/send information. AJAX allows interacting with a website's server.
        </p>
        <p>
            <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> exist to store data (plain data to cut out HTML, CSS, and Javascript junk) that servers might request (interaction between softwares). Web API are HTTP-based so that servers can use them for websites. Requests are made to API's URL.
        </p>
        <p>
            XML used to be the standard format for API-s, but nowadays it is replaced by <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> format. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">website</a> contains the documentation for JSON format. Generally, it was developed to suit well for Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
            This <a href="https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/">website</a> helps with json syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> and <a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Hopp Scotch</a> (free) allow testing requests by URL. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Request <em>status codes</em> provide information about request (e.g. 200 = OK, 404 = Not Found)
        </p>
        <p>
            Asked Adam on 11/29/2022 about JSON and pages.
            <br>
            For JSON consistency: create a JSON outline file ( <a href="https://json-schema.org/">json schema</a> ) and run it through JSON validator. THuis way, I have documentation and consistent format.
            <br>
            A project's information could be stored as JSON locally, or in Browser's storage. Browsers allow changing local files.
            <br>
            For Project page: a JSON stores all data about a project. According to a user's status, information is provded on a page or prohibited.

            RestSharp might be the solution to handle requests and responses.
            <br>
            I need to understand what a web server is and do I really need it:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Is a server required if I use RestSharp library?</li>
                <li>A browser button initializes POST request. Does it provide user input only or information about user too (like his current link)?</li>
                <li>I can get away with GET for opening a project. POST, however, is required to create and manage a project</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            12/18/2022. I am stuck on sending/receiving a proper server request.
            <br>
            Try solve by studying REST API
